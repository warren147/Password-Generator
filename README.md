## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the latest version of Java SE<br>
Download Java SE [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)


## Executing Program

Download the code to your local device. Then, run the "Main.class" file to open the game. 

## Inspiration

In my cryptography class, I learned the importance of creating strong and different passwords for different accounts. I have used several different password generators online, but they lack the ability for users to save their newly generated passwords, which causes them to forget their passwords easily. I created this password generator that allows users to generate random passwords and save them so no one will ever get hacked or forget their passwords again!!

## Future Development

Encrypt the generated passwords, add more parameters when creating passwords, implement security measures when the user is trying to access the password history.
